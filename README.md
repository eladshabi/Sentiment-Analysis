In the following code we built a convolutional neural network using keras library,<br>
that gets as an input 32X32 pixels grayscale images of flowers, and generates an output of 96X96 colored flowers images.

* <b>Data-Sets</b><br>
We used a data set that contains 8189 pairs of grayscale and colored flower images<br>
The training set is consisted of 70% of the images, while the test set is consisted of 30% of them. 10% of the training images are used for validation.<br>

* <b>Model's Network Architecture</b><br>
We've been experimenting with several different designs of the network.<br>
In every model we chose to use RELU activation function on the hidden layers of the network.<br>
On the output layer we used sigmoid function in order to output values between 0 and 1.<br>
Generally the network processed the input image in such a way that it has been shrinked on the first few layers and than upscaled to the desired output dimensions. We used strides and up-sampling in order to do so.<br>
We achieved the best results for this assignment using the described method.<br>
Overfitting on these kind of networks is a subjective matter, therefore we needed to examine the results and determine wether they match our expectations.

* <b>Model's Training</b><br>
We normalized the input pixel values to be between 0 and 1, and used the mean square error loss function to measure our results.<br>
After that we also tried using the "msle" loss function which we found more suitable for our project.
On both occasions we used the "rmsprop" optimizer to minimize our loss.

* <b>Performance</b><br>
We were suprised by our initial results, it seemed like the network recognized the shapes and textures of the input images, and also colored them nicely.<br>
The only issue we had is the lack of sharpness of the output images.<br>
We then added more convolutional layers to deepen our network and we increased the amount of filters in each layer dramatically. Furthermore we tested different batch sizes and number of epochs.<br>
The output images became more sharp and clear, the results were way over our expectations.
